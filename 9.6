1. Explain about the different complex data types in pig ?

ATOM
Any single value in Pig Latin, irrespective of their data or type is known as an Atom.`
A simple atomic or piece of data value is known as a field.
Example − ‘sowmiyan’ or ‘100’

TUPLE

A record that is formed by an ordered set of fields is known as a tuple, the fields can
be of any type.

Example- (sowmiyan,100)

BAG

A bag is an unordered set of tuples.
In other words, a collection of tuples (non-unique) is known as a bag.
A bag can have duplicate tuples.
A bag can have tuples with differing numbers of fields. However, if Pig tries to access a field that does not exist, a null value is substituted.
A bag can have tuples with fields that have different data types.

Example − {(suresh, 15), (ramesh, 30)}

MAP

A map (or data map) is a set of key-value pairs. 
The key needs to be of type chararray and should be unique.
The value might be of any type.
It is represented by ‘[]’.

Example: [name#sowmiyan, age#24]


2. How can you interact with the shell in Apache pig ?

There are two ways:

                      1) With Grunt shell.
                      2) Using script files.
                      
With GRUNT SHELL:

Interactive Shell for executing Pig Commands
Can execute scripts from Grunt via run or exec commands
Used when script file is not provided

Using SCRIPT FILES:

Executes Commands in a file
Pig ScriptFile.pig
Pig commands are executed using script files as batch Jobs


3. Explain how pig differs from Map reduce ?

PIG

-Apache Pig is a data flow language.	
-It is a high level language.	
-Performing a Join operation in Apache Pig is pretty simple.	
-Any novice programmer with a basic knowledge of SQL can work conveniently with Apache Pig.	
-Apache Pig uses multi-query approach, thereby reducing the length of the codes to a great extent.	
-There is no need for compilation.
-On execution, every Apache Pig operator is converted internally into a MapReduce job.	

MAP REDUCE

-MapReduce is a data processing paradigm.
-MapReduce is low level and rigid.
-It is quite difficult in MapReduce to perform a Join operation between datasets.
-MapReduce will require almost 20 times more the number of lines to perform the same task.
-MapReduce jobs have a long compilation process.



4. Explain how pig differs from sql ?

PIG:

-Pig Latin is a procedural language.	
-In Apache Pig, schema is optional. We can store data without designing a schema (values are stored as $01, $02 etc.)	
-The data model in Apache Pig is nested relational.	
-Apache Pig provides limited opportunity for Query optimization.

SQL :

-SQL is a declarative language.
-Schema is mandatory in SQL.
-The data model used in SQL is flat relational.
-There is more opportunity for query optimization in SQL.



5. Explain the scalar data types in pig

The scalar Data Types in pig are
1.Int
2.Long
3.Float
4.Doublr
5.Chararray
6.Bytearray


INT

It is like integer datatype in java. Int are represented in interfaces by java.lang.Integer.
They store a four-byte signed integer. Constant integers are expressed as integer numbers, for example, 42.

LONG

It is like Long datatype in java. Longs are represented in interfaces by java.lang.Long.
They store an eight-byte signed integer. Constant longs are expressed as integer numbers with an L appended, for example, 5000000000L.

FLOAT

It is like integer datatype in java A floating-point number.
Floats are represented in interfaces by java.lang.Float and use four bytes to store their value.
Since this is a floating-point number, in some calculations it will lose precision.
For calculations that require no loss of precision, you should use an int or long instead.
Constant floats are expressed as a floating-point number with an f appended.
Floating-point numbers can be expressed in simple format, 3.14f, or in exponent format, 6.022e23f.

DOUBLE

A double-precision floating-point number.
Doubles are represented in interfaces by java.lang.Double and use eight bytes to store their value.
You can find the range of values representable by Java’s Double type.
Note that because this is a floating-point number, in some calculations it will lose precision.
For calculations that require no loss of precision, you should use an int or long instead.
Constant doubles are expressed as a floating-point number in either simple format, 2.71828, or in exponent format, 6.626e-34.

CHARARRAY

 Chararrays are represented in interfaces by java.lang.String.
 Constant chararrays are expressed as string literals with single quotes, for example, 'SOWMIYAN'.
 In addition to standard alphanumeric and symbolic characters, you can express certain characters in chararrays by using backslash codes,
 such as \t for Tab and \n for Return. Unicode characters can be expressed as \u followed by their four-digit hexadecimal Unicode value.
